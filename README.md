This is a tool for an education center to use for parents to sign their kids up for art classes. Specifically, I made it with hopes that the Sitar Arts Center in my neighborhood of Adams Morgan in DC, a non-profit center for art classes for kids and families of all economic backgrounds, would be able to use it in real life because currently they only have paper sign-up, but the programs department tells me that most families don't have printers and would do well to be able to sign up online. I'd also feel good knowing I saved some trees.

Notes while setting this up so far:
* I need models for classes, kids, parents, and teachers.
* Teachers have many students and have many classes. Teachers have many parents through students.
* Kids have many classes and belong to parents.
* Parents have many classes and many kids, and have many Teachers through classes.
* Classes belong to teachers, belong to kids, and belong to parents. (is this weird?)
